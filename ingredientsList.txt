Allow the nuts to cool for at least 10 minutes before chopping them very briefly in a blender or food processor.

"My taste in food is pretty simple," writes Sara Hainsworth of Frederick, Maryland. "Im a meat-and-potatoes  and chocolate  kind of person. My husband, Greg, and I cook together a lot, which is fun and makes weeknight dinners and cooking for friends easier to manage now that were starting our own family. I worked before our son, William, was born, but as my husband says, William is my boss now. So I count on these quick, dependably good dishes more than ever."
