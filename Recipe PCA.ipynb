    "\n",

    "##### when quantities don't add nicely\n",
    "- \"1/2 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons red wine vinegar\"\n",
    "- \"1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons granola\"\n",
    "- \"1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon warm water\"\n",
    "- \"1/4 teaspoon plus 1/3 cup sugar\"\n",
    "- \"2 tablespoons plus 1/2 cup chopped fresh dill\"\n",
    "- \"1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard\"\n",
    "- \"2/3 cup plus 6 tablespoons coarsely chopped pecans\"\n",
    "- \"1 cup plus 2 tablespoons whole milk\"\n",
    "- \"1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar\"\n",
    "- \"1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons water\"\n",
    "- \"1 tablespoon plus 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\"\n",
    "- \"1 tablespoon plus one teaspoon fresh lemon juice\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These are in a consistent format of UNIT QUANTITY PLUS UNIT QUANTITY INGREDIENT. If we add PLUS as a label, then over the 3k samples we have we might improve, but we might also tag some things as being PLUS when we don't want them to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### when there's a suggestion for more on the side (not a lot of errors there)\n",
    "- \"1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for grilling\"\n",
    "- \"5 teaspoons all-purpose flour plus more for dusting\"\n",
    "- \"2 tablespoons drained capers plus more for serving\"\n",
    "- \"1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese plus additional for passing\"\n",
    "- \"12 rice-paper rounds, plus more in case some tear\"\n",
    "- \"1 can whole tomatoes, plus juice\"\n",
    "- \"1 tablespoon chile oil containing sesame oil plus some of sediment from jar\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These ones seem like i can just remove all the words after the plus.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### other, stupid ones\n",
    "- \"8 cornichons, finely chopped, plus 2 pickled onions from the jar, minced\"\n",
    "- \"1/2 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, chopped, plus 2 tablespoons tomato oil\"\n",
    "- \"1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves or 1 teaspoon crumbled dried, plus rosemary sprigs for garnish\"\n",
    "- \"Juice of 1/4 lime, plus 1 lime wedge for garnish\"\n",
    "- \"1 1/2 cups sugar, plus 1/4 cup mixed with 1 tablespoon cinnamon, on a plate\"\n",
    "- \"1/2 fennel bulb, finely chopped, plus 1 tablespoon finely chopped fronds\"\n",
    "- \"1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro plus 32 whole fresh cilantro leaves\"\n",
    "- \"6 large celery stalks, thickly sliced, plus 2 1/2 cups 1/2-inch-thick slices\"\n",
    "- \"6 fresh mint leaves plus 1 mint sprig for garnish\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So also there's like a utility function that might need to be taken into account: we really want our data to fit the format nicely of having a name, a unit, and a quantity. \n",
    "\n",
    "A really, really easy way to deal with all of this is just to get rid of all the \"plus\" ingredient listings, which are only ~3000 out of the 83k samples. It might mess up the data but it's easier. Also none of this is training or testing data, this is like actually \"I need this\" data so it's convenient if I just scrap the shitty stuff.
